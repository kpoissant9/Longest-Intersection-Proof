# Longest-Intersection-Proof
This repository contains the proof that the sum of the lengths of the longest intersections between two lists will be shorter than a specified upper bound dependent on the length of the shorter list.
To run the lisp file, make sure you have ACL2s downloaded. Load this lisp file into a project, check the file is in ACL2s mode, start a new session and run the full Proof.lisp file up until the final 2 lemmas (list-intersect-iterate-through-a-shorter-than-upper-bound and my-list-intersect-shorter-than-upper-bound).
